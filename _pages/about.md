I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. I am advised by Prof. [Sonia Fahmy](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/fahmy/) at [PurNet Lab](https://gitlab.com/purnet-lab/purnet-lab.gitlab.io/-/wikis/home). Previously, I earned my master’s in Computer Systems Networking & Telecommunications from Northeastern University, Boston, MA.
<!--- Before joining Purdue, I worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, with primary focus on software development, architecture designing and building automation infrastructure for Affirmed Networks' Cloud Native 5G Mobile Core solution. Prior to that, I completed my master’s in Computer Systems Networking & Telecommunications from Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA. -->

Research
======

My research focuses on 5G core networks, Wi-Fi networks, and cloud-computing, leveraging learning-based techniques to optimize their performance. Currently, I am working on reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance 5G cellular network efficiency amd management.

<!--- 
The main focus of my research is to enhance the user's QoE across various types of networks. For 5G cellular core networks, I proposed state management optimizations to reduce NF-to-database transaction times, significantly improving call setup time. In backhaul networks, I developed a multipath routing algorithm based on statistical flow measures to improve QoE for multimedia applications. For Wi-Fi networks, I introduced a QoE-aware dynamic resource allocation policy, particularly for long-duration QoE-sensitive flows. Recently, I designed a lightweight, protocol-agnostic Zero-Trust security architecture for 5G core networks. Currently, I am working on making this security solution adaptive to further optimize call setup time while maintaining a balance between performance and security.
