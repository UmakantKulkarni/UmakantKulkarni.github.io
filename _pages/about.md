I am a Research Scientist in the Mobile Network Systems Department at Nokia Bell Labs. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Purdue University, advised by Prof. [Sonia Fahmy](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/fahmy/) at [PurNet Lab](https://gitlab.com/purnet-lab/purnet-lab.gitlab.io/-/wikis/home). My [dissertation](https://doi.org/10.25394/PGS.30752984) developed operator-centric strategies to enhance performance and reliability of cloud-native 5G core and Wi-Fi access networks. 

Before joining Purdue, I worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, focusing on software development, architecture designing and building automation infrastructure for Affirmed Networks' cloud-native 5G mobile core solution. Prior to that, I completed my master’s in Computer Systems Networking & Telecommunications from Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.

Research
======

My research sits at the intersection of cellular networks and distributed systems, with a focus on integrating modern AI-driven techniques into operator networks. I build practical methods for configuration, resource management, orchestration, and elastic scaling to improve the performance and reliability of cloud-native mobile core systems. I am especially interested in how learning-based approaches, including LLMs and other ML techniques, can make cellular networks more efficient, robust, and easier to operate at scale.
